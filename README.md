# DataScience_SmallProject_01
This mini-project can be used to generate data about individuals, including name, surname, address (with latitude and longitude), profession and monthly income in a completely random way. Serving Data Visualization projects and other projects in the Data Science area.  The objective of this mini-project was to show the use of three tools that I usually use (MS Excel, Python and MS Power BI) in an integrated way with a focus on problem solving. First, MS Excel was used to generate random data with consistency, which serves as a basis for testing and applying data analysis techniques in the same tool or in other tools. Second, Python was used to enrich the result of the generated data, using a geolocation API. Finally, the Power BI tool was used for visualization | summary of the generated data.
